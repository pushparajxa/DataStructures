In TreeMap when keys are iterated, you get them in sorted order based on their compareTo method.

 TreeMap use red-black tree implementation, which gives constant o(logn) times for inserts, deletes
 and search


HashMap
  --> No guarantee on the order of keys iteration.
  --> It will rehash when the number of keys reaches a particular threshold.
  --> During collision, instead of separate chaining, now it uses TreeMap giving guarantee on o
  (logn) insertion time.
