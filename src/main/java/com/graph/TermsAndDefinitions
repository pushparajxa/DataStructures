Forest: A graph without cycles (Forest will have one or many trees)
Tree: Connected components of a forest

=====================================================================
subgraph:
A subgraph of a graph G is another graph formed from a subset of the vertices and edges of G.
The vertex subset must include all endpoints of the edge subset, but may also include additional vertices.

supergraph:
A graph formed by adding vertices, edges, or both to a given graph. If H is a subgraph of G, then G is a supergraph of H.

Spanning Subgraph: A subgraph which contains all the vertices of the given graph
Spanning tree of a graph: A spanning subgraph of the given graph which is a tree(no cycles)
Spanning tree T of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the
vertices of G, with minimum possible number of edges.

======================================================
Connected Component: ==> Used for undirected graph. For directed graph, it is called strongly connected component
In graph theory, a component, sometimes called a connected component, of an undirected graph is a
subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory)
==================================================
Walk : sequence of edges and vertices (both of them can be repeated)
Trail: A walk in which all the edges are distinct
Path: A walk in which all vertices (therefore all edges are distinct)
Simple path: A path in which all vertices are not distinct
