  Algorithm defined in Algorithm Design(Goodrich)
  and DFS based in Wikipedia

  Depth-first search[edit]
An alternative algorithm for topological sorting is based on depth-first search. The algorithm loops through each node of the graph, in an arbitrary order,
initiating a depth-first search that terminates when it hits any node that has already been visited since the beginning of the topological
sort or the node has no outgoing edges (i.e. a leaf node):

L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
while exists nodes without a permanent mark do
    select an unmarked node n
    visit(n)

function visit(node n)
    if n has a permanent mark then return
    if n has a temporary mark then stop   (not a DAG)
    mark n with a temporary mark
    for each node m with an edge from n to m do
        visit(m)
    remove temporary mark from n
    mark n with a permanent mark
    add n to head of L
Each node n gets prepended to the output list L only after considering all other nodes which depend on n (all descendants of n in the graph).
Specifically, when the algorithm adds node n, we are guaranteed that all nodes which depend on n are already in the output list L: they were
 added to L either by the recursive call to visit()
which ended before the call to visit n, or by a call to visit() which started even before the call to visit n.
Since each edge and node is visited once, the algorithm runs in linear time. This depth-first-search-based algorithm is
the one described by Cormen et al. (2001); it seems to have been first described in print by Tarjan (1976).
