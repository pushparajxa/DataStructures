// A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between any two vertices.

// Refer: Testing for Strong connectivity, page no: 319, Goodrich.
// The same algorithm is described here http://www.cs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/253/Syllabus/Graph/strong-conn.html
// Its running time is O(n+m)

// We can also use algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in the digraph. If the number
// turns out be 1 then we can say that the given digraph is strongly connected.
