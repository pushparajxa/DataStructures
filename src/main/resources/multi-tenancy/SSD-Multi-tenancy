What is a Namespace?
======================


In NVMe® technology, a namespace is a collection of logical block addresses (LBA) accessible to host software. A namespace ID (NSID) is an identifier used by a controller to provide access to a namespace. A namespace is not the physical isolation of blocks, rather the isolation of logical blocks addressable by the host software.

In Linux, namespaces appear each with a unique identifier in devices; /dev/nvme0n1 is looking at controller 0 and namespace 1).

There are many reasons why host software would want to break up an NVMe SSD into multiple namespaces: for logical isolation, multi-tenancy, security isolation (encryption per namespace), write protecting a namespace for recovery purposes, overprovisioning to improve write performance and endurance and so on.

On an NVMe SSD by default, the size of the namespace is equal to the size of LBA’s determined by the manufacturer. Each namespace is presented as a separate target device in the host software.



Multiple Namespaces
=====================
Multi-Tenancy:
--------------
A use case may involve having two or more customers using one NVMe SSD. Having more than one customer using one SSD raises concerns of consistency of service, dedicated performance and lowering the cost of having to purchase multiple SSDs. The logical separation between each tenant allows the owner to cater each namespace to the tenant’s workload habits. The SSD can still wear level and share spare areas for garbage collection between namespaces. This is different from NVM Sets where the expectation is physical isolation rather than namespaces, which is logical isolation.
