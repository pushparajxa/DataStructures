  -- CORS is for browsers to tell them whether to display the response from a server.

    -- Open browser and type www.B.com/index.html, Let's say we have call to www.A.com/display to
    fetch an image and show it in index.html(B.com). Browser will display the image only if CORS
    header sent in the response from A.com contains * or B.com

    -- If you call url A from url B in a browser, the response from url A can  only be shown in
    browser if response from url A has Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * or
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin:www.B.com
