The Time-to-Live (TTL) field is an 8-bit field in the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) header that
 serves a critical function: preventing data packets from circulating indefinitely on a network.
The TTL acts as a counter or a "hop limit" for the packet's lifespan.


How the TTL Field Works

    Initial Value:
          When a host sends an IP packet, it sets the TTL field to an initial numerical
          value (often 64, 128, or 255, depending on the operating system).

    Decrementing at Routers:
          Every time the packet passes through a router (a "hop") on its journey,
          the router decrements the TTL value by at least 1.

    Expiration and Discarding:
          If a router receives a packet with a TTL of 1, it decrements it to 0,
          and then discards the packet immediately.

    ICMP Error Message:
          When a router discards a packet due to an expired TTL, it typically sends
          an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the original source IP address.

Purpose and Importance
    The primary purpose of the TTL is to prevent network loops. If a router fails or a routing
    table is incorrectly configured, packets could theoretically bounce back and forth between
     routers forever, consuming bandwidth and system resources.
    By forcing packets to expire after a certain number of hops, the TTL ensures that
    the network clears looped packets efficiently.

Role in the traceroute Command
    The traceroute command specifically manipulates the TTL field to function.
     It sends packets with TTLs of 1, 2, 3, and so on,
    forcing each successive router along the path to discard the packet and send back the necessary
    "Time Exceeded" ICMP message that identifies the router's IP address and measures the RTT (Round-Trip Time).

The IPv6 Equivalent: "Hop Limit"
    In the modern IPv6 protocol, the TTL field has been renamed to the "Hop Limit" field.
    It performs the exact same function as TTL, but the name change clarifies that the counter refers strictly to the number of
    hops (routers visited) and has nothing to do with time measurements.
