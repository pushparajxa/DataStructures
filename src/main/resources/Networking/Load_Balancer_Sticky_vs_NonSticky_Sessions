Layer-3 IP Layer Load Balancing
---------------------------------
Load balancing based on IP Address at network layer.


Layer-4 TCP Layer Load Balancing
---------------------------------
TCP layer balancing without inspecting the contents of the packet. Based on the source ip, port
requests are forwarded to the servers..typically on round-robin fashion.


Layer-7 Application Layer Balancing
-----------------------------------
* Here load balancer decrypts the packets and inspects the packet to find cookies which are used in
sticky-sessions.
* Since it performs decryption, it incurs performance penalty.

HTTP Session
-------------
* HTTP is a stateless protocol, we need a way to remember the client state across the requests, i.e,
  logged in time, ip address etc.. for which server creates a Http Session object.

How load balancer finds with which actual physical server a client session is held?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Load balancer will do TLS decryption and find the session cookie/ session id which it used to
route to the actual physical server.

Sticky Session vs Non-Sticky Session
------------------------------------
* In Sticky session load balancer will always direct requests from user to single physical app
server.
* In Non sticky sessions load balancer can direct requests from client to any of the app servers
behind the load balancer.

Sticky Session vs Session Replication
-------------------------------------
* In Session replication, user session is replicated across all the tomcat instances running behind
load balancer.
* In Sticky session load balacner will always direct requests from user to single physical app  server.
* In Tomcat Session replication is used with Sticky session.

Load balancer vs reverse proxy
------------------------------
Reverse proxy hides the actual server ip and port to the client. You can deploy a reverse proxy
 for a single backend server.

Load balancer distributed load among a group of backend servers.
It doesn't make sense to deploy loadbalancer for a single server.
