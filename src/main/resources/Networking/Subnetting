Classless Addressing
-------------------

To reduce the wastage of IP addresses in a block, we use sub-netting. What we do is that we use host id bits as net id bits of a classful IP address.
We give the IP address and define the number of bits for mask along with it (usually followed by a ‘/’ symbol), like, 192.168.1.1/28. Here, subnet mask is
found by putting the given number of bits out of 32 as 1, like, in the given address, we need to put 28 out of 32 bits as 1 and the rest as 0, and so,
the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.240.


Some values calculated in subnetting :

1. Number of subnets : Given bits for mask – No. of bits in default mask
2. Subnet address : AND result of subnet mask and the given IP address
3. Broadcast address : By putting the host bits as 1 and retaining the network bits as in the IP address
4. Number of hosts per subnet : 2(32 – Given bits for mask) – 2
5. First Host ID : Subnet address + 1 (adding one to the binary representation of the subnet address)
6. Last Host ID : Subnet address + Number of Hosts


Example : Given IP Address – 172.16.0.0/25, find the number of subnets and the number of hosts per subnet. Also, for the first subnet block, find the subnet address,
first host ID, last host ID and broadcast address.

Solution : This is a class B address. So, no. of subnets = 2(25-16) = 29 = 512.

No. of hosts per subnet = 2(32-25) – 2 = 27 – 2 = 128 – 2 = 126

For the first subnet block, we have subnet address = 0.0, first host id = 0.1, last host id = 0.126 and broadcast address = 0.127
