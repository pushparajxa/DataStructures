PUT   :: MUST be idemppotent
====
 - PUT operations should be idempotent. Even if we call PUT request n-times it should create or
 replace only one time

 - The URL should include the resource name


   Used to create a resource, or overwrite it, while you specify the resources URL.

   For a new resource:

   PUT /questions/<new_question> HTTP/1.1
   Host: whateverblahblah.com

   To overwrite an existing resource:

   PUT /questions/<existing_question> HTTP/1.1
   Host: whateverblahblah.com

   ...Yes, they are the same. PUT is often described as the 'edit' method, as by replacing the entire resource with a slightly altered version,
    you have edited what clients will GET when they next do.



    RFC 7231 Section 4.3.4 PUT
    ---------------------------------------

    The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be created or replaced with the state defined by the representation enclosed
     in the request message payload.



POST : Used to create a resource
================================
 - This is not idempotent. Calling POST n times will create n resources
 - We should not include a resource that doesn't exist already in the URL.
 - We use this to create new resources given that resource id is specified.


   Note that the following is an error:

   POST /questions/<new_question> HTTP/1.1
   Host: whateverblahblah.com

   If the URL is not yet created, you should not be using POST to create it while specifying the name.
   This should result in a resource not found error because does not exist yet. You should PUT the resource on the server first.
   You could argue that by creating a new question, you are also updating the /questions resource as it would now return one more question
   in its list of questions.

   You should do something like this to create a resource using POST:

   POST /questions HTTP/1.1
   Host: whateverblahblah.com

   Note that in this case the resource name is not specified, the new objects URL path would be returned to you.

While chossing between POST and PUT, think in terms of idempotency. PUT operations must be
idempotent.
