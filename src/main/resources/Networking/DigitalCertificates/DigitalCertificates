When a client does https://www.google.com in the browser, browser will get the ip address A record
through Domain Name Servers. Once it gets the ip address, it will initiate handshake with the server
 on TCP 443 (HTTPS) port.
    + Server will send the certificates of all the intermediate CA except root CA.
    + Root CA certificate is pre-installed on any browser.
    + If intermediate CA certificate is missing, an url to fetch it will be present in the digital
      certificate(AIA field) (Authority Information Access)

      - The AIA extension is supposed to point the client towards an endpoint from which the
        signing certificate can be obtained even if the server does not provide the intermediate
        certificates as part of the TLS handshake.

How Man in the middle attack can take place (MITM) in TLS
==========================================================
 During TLS handshake, a man in the middle can provide a fake public key of the server to the client
 . He will decrypt all the information sent by client. He will read or alter them and forward to the
  server using its actual public key. In this process neither client nor server will be aware that
  someone is listening to their communication.

    2. A MITM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between
     two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. In public key cryptography,
     this can happen if an attacker is able to intercept the public key exchange process, substituting their
     own public key for the intended recipient’s key. Consequently, the attacker can decrypt the messages
     intended for the recipient, read or alter them, and then re-encrypt them with the recipient’s actual
     public key before forwarding them, all without either party being aware of the interception.

 Man in the middle attack is solved by Digital Certificates.


What does a Digital Certificate contain
=======================================
Subject Name
Validity
Subject Public Key
Issuer(Intermediate CA) Name
Issuer(Intermediate CA) Siganture (Made by the intermediate CA's private key).


Certificate Pinning
===================
 Hash of the public key (in most cases) or Digital Certificate is hard coded into the applicaiotn
 through configuration or source code. This way application can verify the public key to avoid man
 in the middle attack when Digital certificate issuing authority is compromised. Attacker will issue
  fake DigitalCertificates and pose as original server. In that situations hash of the pyblic key or
   DigitalCertificate will not match if attacker produces a fake DigitalCertificate.


 - Certificate pinning is not used due to its complexity in implementation. Certificate Transparency
  is use instead.

Certificate Transparency Logs
=============================
 It is an append only certificatelog which can be publicly verified. It contains all the
 certificates that are issued by a CA. This prevents issues that arise when issuing CA system is
 compromised and fake certificates were generated. By the time issuing CA notices this fake
 certificates damage would have already done by client being cheated by fraud.
