Client makes a upgrade(to websockets) request(HTTP) to server. If server supports websockets then it
 responds yes and on that tcp connection they can use webcokets.


If Client connects to reverse proxy or load balancer, there will two connections, one from client to
 reverse proxy server and reverse proxy server to backend server.
 -- Here reverse proxy server acts as L4 load balancer, it streams data between client and backend
 server.
 -- Here reverse proxy server at L7 protocol, deciphers the request and reads the headers for client
  requests.
 -- Sometimes it can acts as gateway, such as router
 -- Reverse proxy servers also terminates TLS to decode the information in the request.
