Proxy or Open Proxy or Reverse Proxy
------------------------------------
* It is a server which takes a request from client and forwards to the destination.
* There are two types of it
  # Anonymous Proxy:
     - Proxy will not reveal the originating IP or the IP of the client who made the request.
     - It will reveal itself as proxy server to the destination.

  # Transparent Proxy:
     - It will also reveal itself as a proxy server to the destination.
     - This will reveal the ip of the client by providing it in the
          X-Forwarded-For Header request variable.


Reverse Proxy
---------------
* It hides the application servers from the clients.
* It presents it self as an ordinary server to the client. It accepts request from the client and
forwards it to the application server. The response from the application server is sent back to the
client. This way client is un-aware of the application server.
* It can load-balance.
* It can do SSL encryption.
* It can cache static content.
