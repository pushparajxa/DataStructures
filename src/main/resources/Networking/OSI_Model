Layer-1: Physical Layer
-----------------------
* Transform bits into electrical,radio or optical signal and send it through Network Interface Card
* voltages, duplex, half-duplex is same as simplex

Layer-2: Data link Layer
-------------------------
* Deals about sending frames over physical media.
* Ethernet, 802.11 WiFi

Layer-3 Network Layer
-----------------------
* Routing the packets through different networks.
* IP, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, IPSec are sample routing protocols.

Layer-4 Transmission Layer
---------------------------
* The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host
from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions. Transport protocols may be connection-oriented or connectionless.
* Reliability, QoS, Flow Control
* TCP, UDP

Layer-5 Session Layer
---------------------
* DNS, Sockets
* establishes procedures for checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session between two related streams of data,
  such as an audio and a video stream in a web-conferencing application.

Layer-6 Presentation Layer
--------------------------
* Encryption -- SSL/TLS
* Conversion of data to MIME types such as TEXT, JSON etc..

Layer-7 Application Layer
-------------------------
* A way for client to send files, send mails to servers.
* HTTP, SMTP, FTP, SCP, SSH
