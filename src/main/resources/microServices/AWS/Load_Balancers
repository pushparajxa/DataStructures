Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers:

    Application Load Balancers

    Network Load Balancers

    Gateway Load Balancers

    Classic Load Balancers

There is a key difference in how the load balancer types are configured. With Application Load Balancers,
Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers, you register targets in target groups, and route traffic to the target groups.
With Classic Load Balancers, you register instances with the load balancer.


Application Load Balancers (ALBs)
==================================

# These operate at L7.
# They have listeners, each listener looks at each request and based on the configured rules, it
  routes requests to a target in the target group.
# One or many target groups registers with a load balancer. Each target groups contains one or many
  targets.
# A target can be part of many target groups.
# Each target group also has a health checker which checks the health of the targets in the group
  and notifies load balancer.



    Cross-zone load balancers
    =========================
    * There can be many load balancer nodes in a load balancer. Each load balancer can be attached to an
      availability zone. A load balancer node can distribute requests to targets in other availability
      zones which are under another load balancer node.
    * When a client requests comes, it goes to ROUTE 53, which resolves it to a load balancer. Then
      request is forwarded to that load balancer.
    * Before a client sends a request to your load balancer, it resolves the load balancer's domain name using a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
      The DNS entry is controlled by Amazon, because your load balancers are in the amazonaws.com
      domain. The Amazon DNS servers return one or more IP addresses to the client. These are the IP
       addresses of the load balancer nodes for your load balancer.
