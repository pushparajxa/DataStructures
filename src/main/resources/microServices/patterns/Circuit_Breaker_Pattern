# Asynchronous circuit breakers
 - Most circuit breakers are synchronous in nature.
 - In asynchronous systems, consumer read messages through queue. This way upstream and downstream
 are decoupled.
 - In this setup, we can put synchronous circuit breaker before the queue, which stops inserting
 elements into the queue when the consumer is also and queue start getting full.
