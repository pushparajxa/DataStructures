# Service Registry
  - Registration and deregistration of services :: Services register with registry with their
  address
  - Registry checks the health of registered services

# Clients can directly talk to service registry and get the address of the required service.

# Or, clients connect to load balancer, which asks registry for address and forwards that address to
 the client.
