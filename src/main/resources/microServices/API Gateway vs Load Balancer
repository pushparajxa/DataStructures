API Gateway
============
It does many jobs, as mentioned here https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/features/

1. SDK Generation for API in different lanaguages
2. Metrics
3. Support both RESTFul and WebSocket APIs
4. Throttling and resiliency
5. API keys for third part developer integrations
6. Authorization by directing calls to IAM or Cognito
7. Protocol translation

API Gateway vs Load balancer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/61619662/1171533
=============================================
API gateway predominately does API management and provides various other key features such as IAM (Identity and Access Management), Rate limiting,
circuit breakers. Hence, it mainly eliminates the need to implement API-specific code for functionalities such as security, caching, throttling, and
monitoring for each of the microservice.
Microservices typically expose the REST APIs for use in front ends, other microservices and 3rd party apps with help of API gateway.

However, normally, the API Management does not include load balancing function, so it should be used in conjunction with a load balancer to achieve the same.

In system architecture based on Azure, there is Azure Application Gateway which is a load balancer that runs on Layer 7 and
provides more features than traditional load balancer ( Layer 4 ) in terms of routing traffic using routing decisions based on additional attributes of
HTTP request or content of traffic. This can also be termed as an application load balancer. It shall be used in conjunction by Azure API Management (API gateway).
 Azure has a Traffic Manager for operating at DNS level which uses DNS to direct client requests to the most appropriate service endpoint based on a traffic-routing
 method and the health of the endpoints. Traffic manager also uses the rules configured at the DNS
 level and enables distribution of the the load over multiple regions and data centers. Within every
  region or data center, there shall be application gateways coupled with load balancers such that,
the application gateways shall help in determining the application server to fetch response from and the load balancer shall help in load balancing.
