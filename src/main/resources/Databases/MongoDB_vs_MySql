A key benefit of the MongoDB design is that the database is extremely easy to scale.
 Configuring a sharded cluster allows a portion of the database, called a shard,
 to also be configured as a replica set. In a sharded cluster, data is distributed
 across many servers. This highly flexible approach allows MongoDB to horizontally
 scale both read and write performance to cater to applications of any scale.

A replica set is the replication of a group of MongoDB servers that hold the same data,
ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.

With a MySQL database system, options for scalability are much more limited.
 Typically, you have two choices: vertical scalability, or adding read replicas.
 Scaling vertically involves adding more resources to the existing database server, but this has an inherent upper limit.

Read replication involves adding read-only copies of the database to other servers.
 However, this is typically limited to five replicas in total, which can only be used for read operations.
 This can cause issues with applications that are either write-heavy, or write and read regularly for the database,
since itâ€™s common for replicas to lag behind the write master.
Multi-master replication support has been added to MySQL, but its implementation is more
limited than the functionality available in MongoDB.
