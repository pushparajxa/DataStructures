Two Phase Commit
----------------

  Phase-1
  --------
   - Once TC knows that actions at different nodes have been completed, it tries to commit/abort the
    transaction.
   - TC: Transaction coordinator splits the task into multiple sub-transactions that are to be
   executed at different nodes.

   - TC will send PREPARE message to each node.

   - PT/TM: Participant/Local Transaction Manager, if it thinks that it can commit changes, then it
   will persist READY to log and sends it to TC.

   - If TM wants to abort its transaction(local) then it writes ABORT to log and sends it to TC.


   Phase-2
   --------
   - TC will collect messages from all the TMs and if any one says ABORT then it will send ABORT to
   all the TMs.

   - If anyone doesn't reply in a timeout window then it will send ABORT to all. (Writes ABORT to
      its logs)

   - If all TMs says READY then it will send COMMIT to all the TMs

   - TC will write COMMIT/ABORT to its log before sending it out to all the TMs.

   - TMs will write COMMIT/ABORT into its log and then proceeds with committing the transaction.


   Failure scenarios
   =================
    TMs
    ---
    1. Fails before PREPARE message

    2. Fails after receiving PREPARE message but before sending READY/ABORT to TC

    3. Fails after sending READY/ABORT to TC

    4. Fails after receiving COMMIT & processing it, from TC.


    Case 1 & 2, --> During recovery it can contact peers or TC to get latest state.

    Case 3 --> Same as gets latest state from TC (even if it wrote ABORT to its log and crashed)

    Case 4 --> During recovery it should re-execute the transaction/commit it locally.


    TC
    --
    1. Crashes after sending PREPARE message

    2. Crash after receiving READY/ABORT messages from TMs.

    3. Crash after sending COMMIT/ABORT to the TMs or crashes after sending to only few of them.

    4. TC sends COMMIT/ABORT to nodes but only few receive them due to network partition.

    Case 1 & 2 --> Refers to a situation where a decision has not been made by the TC or decision
                    has been made(also persisted to disk) by it but crashed before sending it to TMs

    Case  3& 4  ---> Refers to a situation where TC has made a decision but didn't reach every one.

    Case 1 & 2  --> TMs would have sent READY or ABORT after receiving the PREPARE
                     message. If they have sent READY then they will block until to hear from TC (to
                      COMMIT or ABORT)

    Case 3 ---> TMs have to co-ordinate among themselves.  And those who do not receive  the
    COMMIT/ABORT will block.

    Case 4---> Those didn't receive will check with others. If there is a network partition then
    some may block as they might not if anyone has received COMMIT/ABORT message.

  When TMs are in Ready state and waiting for TC to send COMMIT/ABORT then if TC crashes, TMs would
  be waiting by holding the locks on the resources.


  3 PC    (An improvement over 2 PC to handle the case of coordinator crash).
  -----

  1. PreCommit from TC to TMs
      canCommit from TMs to TC

  2. PreCommit/Abort from TC to TMs
     Commit/Abort from TMs to TC

 3. Commit from TC to TMs.
      If Commit haven't received from TC yet, then a TM can commit because it has received PreCommit
       .. which means that from step1 all TMs have voted for commit.


 * In Step-1 resources/locks are not held by the process.


 Inconsistency issue:
 --------------------
   During step-3, say TCs has crashed before sending Abort to TMs, some TMs will commit after
   timeout because they haven't heard from TC within timeout period. But those who has sent Abort on
    Step-2 will do Abort at the same time. This leads to some TMs committing and some Aborting.

The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) algorithm is a standard distributed protocol used to ensure atomicity across
multiple participants in a distributed transaction. The goal is that
all participants either commit the transaction (make their changes permanent) or abort (roll back their changes).


The process is managed by a central coordinator and several participants (data resources or nodes).
 It involves two distinct phases: the Prepare Phase (Phase 1) and the Commit Phase (Phase 2).

Phase 1: The Prepare Phase (Voting Phase)
-----------------------------------------
The coordinator sends a "prepare" request to all participants to ensure
they are ready to commit the transaction and can guarantee their ability to
 make the changes permanent, even in the face of failure.

What Happens in the Prepare Phase:

    Coordinator Actions:
        The coordinator sends a <PREPARE> message to all participants involved in the transaction.
        It then waits for responses from all participants.

    Participant Actions:

        Upon receiving the <PREPARE> message, each participant performs the necessary actions to be ready to commit. This typically involves:
            Ensuring the local transaction operations are completed.
            Writing all transaction logs to stable storage (ensuring durability).
            Acquiring all necessary local locks to isolate the transaction.
            Crucially, the participant must guarantee it can complete the commit or abort process once it has voted "yes".

        The participant then votes:
            If ready to commit: The participant sends a <VOTE_COMMIT> (or "Yes") message back to the coordinator.
            The participant is now in a "prepared" or "ready" state and must wait for the final decision from the coordinator.

            If not ready: The participant sends a <VOTE_ABORT> (or "No") message back to the
            coordinator and immediately rolls back its local transaction.

Phase 2: The Commit Phase (Decision Phase)
-----------------------------------------
Based on the votes received in Phase 1, the coordinator makes the final decision on whether
 to commit or abort the entire global transaction and broadcasts this decision to all participants.

What Happens in the Commit Phase:

    Coordinator Actions:
        If all participants voted "Yes" (<VOTE_COMMIT>):
            The coordinator decides to commit the transaction globally.
            It records a "global commit" record in its own log and sends a <GLOBAL_COMMIT> message to all participants.
        If any participant voted "No" (<VOTE_ABORT}), or a participant failed to respond:
            The coordinator decides to abort the transaction globally.
            It records a "global abort" record in its own log and sends a <GLOBAL_ABORT> message to all participants.
    Participant Actions:
        Upon receiving the coordinator's decision message:
            If <GLOBAL_COMMIT> is received: The participant locally commits the transaction, makes
                the changes permanent in the database, releases all held locks,
                and sends a <ACK> (acknowledgment) back to the coordinator.
            If <GLOBAL_ABORT> is received: The participant locally aborts/rolls back the transaction
             (using the logs written in Phase 1), releases all held locks, and sends an <ACK> back to the coordinator.


    Final Step: Once the coordinator receives acknowledgments (<ACK>) from all participants that
    successfully processed the final decision, it considers the distributed transaction complete.
