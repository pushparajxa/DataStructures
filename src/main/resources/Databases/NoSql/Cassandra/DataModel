Introduction
--------------
- Cassandra is column-family oriented database. Specifically, below.

- Cassandra is sparse. Each row, need not to have all the columns.

- Apache Cassandra is a highly-scalable partitioned row store. Rows are organized into tables with a
required primary key.

- Partitioning means that Cassandra can distribute your data across multiple machines in an
application-transparent matter. Cassandra will automatically repartition as machines are added and removed from the cluster.

- Row store means that like relational databases, Cassandra organizes data by rows and columns.

DataModel
-----------
- Cassandra is a partitioned row store, where rows are organized into tables with a required primary
 key.

- The first component of a table's primary key is the partition key; within a partition, rows are
clustered by the remaining columns of the PK. Other columns may be indexed independent of the PK.

- The Cassandra column values are just bytes, but can be typed as ASCII, UTF8 text, numbers, dates etc.
