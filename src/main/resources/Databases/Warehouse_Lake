The key differences between a data warehouse and a data lake are:

1. Data Structure:
   - Data Warehouse: Stores structured, processed data with a predefined schema[1][2].
   - Data Lake: Stores raw, unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data in its native format without a predefined schema[1][2].

2. Schema Enforcement:
   - Data Warehouse: Employs a "schema-on-write" approach, where data is organized, defined, and metadata is applied before storage[1][2].
   - Data Lake: Uses a "schema-on-read" approach, allowing data to be stored in its raw form without enforcing a schema during ingestion[1][2][3].

3. Data Processing:
   - Data Warehouse: Data undergoes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) before storage, ensuring it's cleaned and structured[1][3].
   - Data Lake: Supports ELT (Extract, Load, Transform), where data is stored first and transformed only when needed[3].

4. Use Cases:
   - Data Warehouse: Optimized for business intelligence, reporting, and structured querying[2].
   - Data Lake: Suitable for big data analytics, machine learning, and handling diverse data types[2].

5. Users:
   - Data Warehouse: Primarily used by business analysts and professionals for specific analytical reports and dashboards[2].
   - Data Lake: Used by data scientists and engineers for detailed analysis and experimentation with raw data[2].

6. Scalability and Cost:
   - Data Warehouse: Scalable but can be more expensive and complex to scale[2].
   - Data Lake: Highly scalable and generally more cost-effective for storing large volumes of data[2][3].

To answer your specific question: Yes, a data lake typically doesn't enforce any schema while writing data. It allows for the storage of raw data in its original format without requiring a predefined structure or schema during ingestion[1][2][3]. This flexibility is one of the key advantages of a data lake, enabling organizations to store diverse data types and volumes without the need for upfront data modeling or transformation.
