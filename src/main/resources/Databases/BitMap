When we have low cardinality columns, i.e, columns which can have only few values, like, Gender,
which has only four values, male, female, etc..

  If we store "Male" or "Female" for each row, then we would be having 4 bytes (Male --> String) for
   each row. Which wastes memory.


  To save this storage, we will keep bit array for each possible value of the column.
     BitMap for "Male"
     BitMap for "Female"

   We take the value of the column for the each row and set the bit corresponding to that row "1".
