Clustered Index
  --> It is supported by MySql InnoDB.
  --> Rows are stored in the same order as the index entries.
      --> If we are inserting a new row then we need to insert its index entry in the correct place.
           Also, we need to identify the disk page in which to insert this new row. If the space is
           not sufficient then we need to split it.

  --> Postgres doesn't have clustered Index. New rows are inserted at the end like heap and index
       entry will point to that address.
