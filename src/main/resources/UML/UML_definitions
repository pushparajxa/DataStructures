Association:  A solid line, can be bi-directional

  An association is a solid line between two classes, directed from the source class to the target class.
  The name of the property goes at the target end of the association, together with its multiplicity.
  The target end of the association links to the class that is the type of the property.


Dependency: Uni directional, represented by dashed lines with arrow at the end.

    The important thing here is that the dependency is in only one direction and goes from the presentation class to the domain class.


Constraint:

    {disallow incest: husband and wife must not be siblings}.


Visibility:

    + -> Public
    - -> Private
    # -> protected
