- DynamoDB is good for writes and reads with high throughput.

- RockDB, BigTable, Cassandra are good for write throughput. They use WAL, MemTable and SSTable
architectures.

- Sloppy Quorum:
  If Dynamo used a traditional quorum approach it would be
  unavailable during server failures and network partitions, and
  would have reduced durability even under the simplest of failure
  conditions. To remedy this it does not enforce strict quorum
  membership and instead it uses a “sloppy quorum”; all read and
  write operations are performed on the first N healthy nodes from
  the preference list, which may not always be the first N nodes
  encountered while walking the consistent hashing ring.
