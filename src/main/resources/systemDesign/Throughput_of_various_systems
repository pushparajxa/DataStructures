    Postgres cluster at Paypal
    --------------------------
    * 55 million transactions per second using 15 Postgres clusters
    * Each cluster has 3 Postgres servers.
    * Each cluster is replicated in two regions. One Main and other is replica.
      Both are in different regions for high availability.
      Data is asynchronously replicated to backup region.
    * Writes are sent to Primary cluster and reads to replica cluster.

================
 * Twitter systems can index search/documents for searching through key terms in one second.
      + That is their system takes at most 1 second for a tweet to appear in search after it was
      created/published.
