Issues with architecture mentioned in Alex Wu book on digital wallet
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In System design interview, an insiders guide volume-2 book, by Alex Wu, in the chapter 12,  Digital Wallet,
he describes a solution based on event sourcing. For every transaction/command it reads the
state of accounts and generates events. However, there would be lag in updating these events.
In the meantime if we receive more commands then there would be inconsistency.  For example.
A has balance 5$. First command is A->C(1$). We generate two events A(-1$), C1(1$),
then another command A->D(5$) comes in,
by the time event A(-1$) has been processed, the account would still show A(5$).
So it will generate two events A(-5$) and D(5$) which is incorrect.
