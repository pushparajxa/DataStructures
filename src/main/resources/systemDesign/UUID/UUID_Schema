UUID is in total 128 bit long , i.e., 16 byte long
    - 60 bits for timestamp, 100 nanosecond intervals of 128 bit UTC timestamp. Least Significant
      bytes are taken.
    - Clock Sequence, a randomly initialized number upon node/machine restart.
      + If timestamps are generated with in the 100 nano second interval, this is incremented.
      + If system clock has been set backwards or if the node was down, upon restart
        if the previous value is known, we can just increment it otherwise we can set it to random
        value.
