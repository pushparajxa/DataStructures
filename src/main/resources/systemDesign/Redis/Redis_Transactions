Redis
  - Doesn't support transactions across cluster nodes
  - It can execute multiple commands on a single node or if all the keys fall to this node in the
  cluster.
  - There is no rollback mechanism provided by it.
  - With MULTI command, after EXEC is called, server will start executing other commands even if one
   fails.
