Master - Replica Model
======================

  If the primary goes down after acknowledging a write but before the write can be replicated, then you might have data loss.
  To avoid this, the client can use the WAIT command. This command blocks the current client until all of the previous write commands are
  successfully transferred and acknowledged by at least some specified number of replicas.

  For example, if we send the command WAIT 2 0, the client will block (will not return a response to the client) until
   all of the previous write commands issued on that connection have been written to at least 2 replicas.
    The second argument - 0 - will instruct the server to block indefinitely, but we could set it to a number (in milliseconds)
    so that it times out after a while and returns the number of replicas that successfully acknowledged the commands.


  Replicas are read-only. This means that you can configure your clients to read from them, but you cannot write data to them.
  If you need additional read throughput, you can configure your Redis client to read from replicas as well as from your primary node.

Sentinel Model
==============
Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis when not using Redis Cluster. It is a tool that provides the automatic failover
in a setup of 1 master and N replicas.

Redis Cluster master-replica model
===================================
To remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are not able to communicate with the majority of nodes,
Redis Cluster uses a master-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N replicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).

In our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not able to continue, since we no longer have a
 way to serve hash slots in the range 5501-11000.

However, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica node to every master, so that the final cluster is
 composed of A, B, C that are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes. This way, the system can continue if node B fails.

Node B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new master and will continue to operate correctly.

However, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.

  Redis cluster doesn't offer strong consistency even when WAIT command is used.

Redis Cluster with hash slots
=============================


  # Hash slots: 16834 slots are there. They can distributed among multiple masters
    Each cluster has 16384 hash slots that can be distributed across all the nodes, and during all operations,
    the Redis client uses the key to calculate the hash by taking the CRC16 of the key modulo 16384.
    Then, it uses it to route the command to the correct node.

  # Hash Tags

    This mechanism helps users guarantee a group of keys go to the same hash slot. To define a hash tag,
     the user has to add a substring between brackets in a key. For instance, the keys app1{user:123}.mykey1 and app1{user:123}.mykey2 would go to the same hash lot.

    By doing this, Redis only uses the substring to generate the hash of the key and, consequently, for routing all keys to the same hash slot.

  # Failover model:
    - Gossip protocol

     Redis Cluster can detect when a primary shard fails and promote a replica to a primary without any manual intervention from the outside.
      How does it do it? How does it know that a primary shard has failed, and how does it promote its replica to be the new primary shard?
      We need to have replication enabled. Say we have one replica for every primary shard. If all our data is divided between three Redis servers,
      we would need a six-member cluster, with three primary shards and three replicas.

     All 6 shards are connected to each other over TCP and constantly PING each other and exchange messages using a binary protocol.
     These messages contain information about which shards have responded with a PONG, so are considered alive, and which haven’t.

Hashtag example
===============
"user:{1001}:name" -> "Alice"

    user:{1001}:name --> is the key. {1001} --> 1001 is the hashtag and based on this it will go to
    corresponding node in the cluster.

    "Alice" is the value.
