Could you explain a scenario where out of order messages with in a partition
would occur?

   If you set retries>0 and
              max.in.flight.requests.per.connection > 1  and
              enable.idempotence to false


It may happen that you send a two batches, one after another, first one fails,
but second one succeeds. first one will be tried again now it succeeds.
This will lead to out of order delivery situation with in a Kafka partition.
