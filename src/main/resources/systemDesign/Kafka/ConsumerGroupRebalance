* Rebalancing happens in following scenarios
  - When a consumer dies
  - When a consumer is added
  - When number of paritions were increased on the topics

* There are two modes of rebalancing
  - Eager Rebalancing
  - cooperative rebalancing

* Eager Rebalacing
  - It is done in two phases
  - Eager rebalances have two distinct phases:
     + first, all consumers give up their assigned partitions and stop consuming
     + second, they rejoin the group, get new partition assignments, and resume consuming messages
     and processing.

* Cooperative Rebalancing
  - The rebalance is done in two or more phases.
    + In the first phase, the leader informs all the consumers that they will lose ownership of some
       partitions, then the consumer will give up their ownership of these partitions.
    + In the next phase, the coordinator will assign these orphaned partitions to their new
      Consumers. The Cooperative rebalance may take a few iterations until a stable partition assignment is achieved,
      but it avoids the unavailability that occurs with the eager approach.
      This is very important in the significantly large consumer groups where rebalance takes more time.
