High watermark: The offset until which log is replicated across all in-sync replicas

Log End Offset: The offset where broker will persists next message received from producer.

LOE is generally greater than High watermark.

# How to get high watermark of a topic partition

  public Map<TopicPartition,Long> endOffsets(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions)

  Get the end offsets for the given partitions. In the default read_uncommitted isolation level,
  the end offset is the high watermark (that is, the offset of the last successfully replicated message plus one).
  For read_committed consumers, the end offset is the last stable offset (LSO), which is the minimum
  of the high watermark and the smallest offset of any open transaction.
  Finally, if the partition has never been written to, the end offset is 0.

  This method does not change the current consumer position of the partitions.

# How to get LEO of a topic partition

  * set Kafka consumer isolation mode to read_uncommitted which is default value.
    - consumerProps.put(ConsumerConfig.ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG, "read_committed")

  * public void seekToEnd(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions)
    Seek to the last offset for each of the given partitions. This function evaluates lazily,
    seeking to the final offset in all partitions only when poll(Duration) or position(TopicPartition) are called.
     If no partitions are provided, seek to the final offset for all of the currently assigned partitions.

    If isolation.level=read_committed, the end offset will be the Last Stable Offset, i.e., the offset of the first message with an open transaction.
