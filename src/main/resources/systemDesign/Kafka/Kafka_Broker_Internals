Does Kafka broker to flush/fsync for rach write? If not, how does it ensure fault-tolerance or
recovery upon crashes?

Zero Copy
=========

# Zero copy reduces CPU times. But this has little effect on Kafka performance since Kafka is IO
intensive. NIC Buffer is the contention point.

# Zero copy is achieved by transferTo method,

  public abstract long transferTo(long position,
                                  long count,
                                  WritableByteChannel target)
                           throws IOException

  Transfers bytes from this channel's file to the given writable byte channel.


  This method is potentially much more efficient than a simple loop that reads from this channel and writes to the target channel.
  Many operating systems can transfer bytes directly from the filesystem cache to the target channel without actually copying them.
