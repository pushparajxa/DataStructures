Timeuuid
--------
  - now()
    - You can generate this in cassandra using now() function. It basically returns a unique
        value similar to UUID.
    - Sample return value of now() functions looks like this 49d59e61-961b-11e8-9854-134d5b3f9cf8

  - Cassandra provides two functions to compare timeuuids
    - SELECT * FROM myTable
         WHERE t > maxTimeuuid('2013-01-01 00:05+0000') --> Constructs a UUID at this timestamp
         AND t < minTimeuuid('2013-02-02 10:00+0000')

         -- This query gives all the results where t is greater than given TimeUUID and lesser than
            given TimeUUID by the minTimeUUID function.
