Timeuuid
--------
  - now()
    - You can generate this in cassandra using now() function. It basically returns a unique
        value similar to UUID.
    - Sample return value of now() functions looks like this 49d59e61-961b-11e8-9854-134d5b3f9cf8

  - Cassandra provides two functions to compare timeuuids
    - SELECT * FROM myTable
         WHERE t > maxTimeuuid('2013-01-01 00:05+0000') --> Constructs a UUID at this timestamp
         AND t < minTimeuuid('2013-02-02 10:00+0000')

         -- This query gives all the results where t is greater than given TimeUUID and lesser than
            given TimeUUID by the minTimeUUID function.

Sharding vs Partitioning vs Striping
----------------------------------------

	In sharding, we divide data into multiple database instances spread across different machines. A table can be shared across multiple database instances.

	In case of striping, we divide a file into multiple blocks and store it in different machines. We can combine with RAID to get durability

	In case of  partitioning, we divide a table into mutliple sub-parts on a single database instance on a single machine.

Durability or handling failure of disks
----------------------------------------
	As of 2023, modern data storage systems can be designed to tolerate the complete failure of a few disks without data loss, using one of 3 approaches:
    ⁃	Replication
    ⁃	RAID
    ⁃	Erasure Coding
	While technically RAID can be seen as a kind of erasure code,"RAID" is generally applied to an array attached to a single host computer (which is a single point of failure), while "erasure coding" generally implies multiple hosts, sometimes called a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Servers 		(RAIS). The erasure code allows operations to continue when any one of those hosts stops.
	Compared to block-level RAID systems, object storage erasure coding has some significant differences that make it more resilient.
