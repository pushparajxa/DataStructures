NP:: a decision problem, if a solution to this problem gives answer YES, then it can be verifiable
in polynomial time.

P:: A problem which can be solvable and verifiable in polynomial time.
    If I have a solution in polynomial time, then I can use to verify an answer to that problem in
    polynomial time. I give the same input to my solution, get its result then compare the answer
    provided to check if they match.

NP-Complete:: All problem in NP should be convertible in polynomial time to an NP-Complete problem.
              An answer "yes" to this problem can be verified in polynomial time.


NP-Hard:
    - Some there problems may not be in NP. That is, an "yes" to the problem is not verifiable in
      polynomial time.
    - All NP-Complete problems are in NP-Hard.
    - All NP problems can be convertible in polynomial to every NP-Hard problem.
      That is to say that a problem can be in NP-Hard only if all NP problems can be reduced in
      polynomial time to that problem.
    - An NP-Hard problem may not need to be in NP. That is, its solution "yes" to a problem may not
      be verifiable in polynomial time.
