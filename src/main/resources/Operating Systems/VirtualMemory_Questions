1. What is virtual memory

2. How virtual memory is used in security?

  2.1 Each process's Virtual memory is protected and can't be accessed by others.

  2.2 Buffer overflow exploits:
        Since OS is adding layer of abstraction over physical memory it can intercept any buffer
        overflow exploit

 2.4 Preventing System Crashes:
     The isolation provided by virtual memory helps to prevent applications from crashing the entire system.
     If one process has a memory-related error, its effect is contained within its virtual memory
     space, rather than impacting other parts of the system or other processes.

 2.5 Mitigating Exploits:
     Virtual memory techniques like dynamic tainting (implemented in hardware by some processors, such as Oracle's Silicon Secured Memory)
     can detect and halt illegal memory accesses, making it harder for attackers to exploit memory
     vulnerabilities.
