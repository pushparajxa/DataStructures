Virtual Memory is a technique where we use secondary memory along with primary memory for processes.

* Paging and Segmentation are both used to implement Virtual Memory.
* Pages are of fixed size but segment size can vary.
* Both support implementing security.
* We can combine segmentation and paging.
* In segmentation we map computer addresses to physical address by adding offset + base.
