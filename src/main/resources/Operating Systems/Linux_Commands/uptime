uptime command
--------------
This command is used to get the system load averages.

uptime  gives  a  one line display of the following information.  The current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are currently logged on,
and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU or
waiting to use the  CPU. A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg  waiting for disk.  The averages are taken over the three time intervals.
Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system
it means it was idle 75% of the time.

Unix uptime includes only CPU usage.

Linux uptime include CPU Usages +  processes in uninterruptible state on either locks or disk.
